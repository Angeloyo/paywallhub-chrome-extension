# PaywallHub Chrome Extension

PaywallHub effectively allows you to remove paywalls or bypass the paywall on an article by simply redirecting you to third-party websites that do that.

## How to install manually

1. Open the Google Chrome browser on your computer.
2. Download latest .zip release from https://github.com/Angeloyo/paywallhub-chrome-extension/releases/latest
3. Click on the three vertical dots in the upper-right corner of the browser, then select 'More tools' and then 'Extensions'.
4. In the new tab that opens, you'll see a switch in the upper-right corner labeled 'Developer mode'. Turn this on.
5. Once 'Developer mode' is enabled, new options will appear. Click on 'Load unpacked'.
6. Navigate to the directory where you saved the extracted zip file for the extension. Select the folder and click 'Open'.
7. The extension should now be manually installed on your Chrome browser.
